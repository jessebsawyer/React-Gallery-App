To run application:
- create a config.js file record your flickr key inside
- put config.js file in the src folder
- run npm start

Going for Exceeds:
- I have added a 404 error page if the route does not exist.
- Loading indicator shows when api is fetching
- No results indicator shows when no results are found.
